        The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do 
        as part of their daily exercise routine.

        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>
            Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing
            position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again
            quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>
            Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on
            the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.
        </dd>
        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>
            Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position,
            bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a
            mountain).
